INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO USE!!!!


1) Executable folder - this contains exe file which can be downloaded and ran

2)notepad++ source - this contains the notepad++ C files which can be compiled and ran through vs developer command prompt like in the labs. Would recommend using this to view the code as it words better than option 4).

3)report - docx file that should be opened in microsoft word

4)visualstudio-sourcecode - contains the visual studio version of the code. would recommend using notepad++ source as the visual studio version sometimes runs into issues with git for some reason


Once the source code has been downloaded it can be ran. Once it runs you will be presented with the game options inside
